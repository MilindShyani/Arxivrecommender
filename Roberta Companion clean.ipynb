      "17) Paper title : ['One-Loop BPS amplitudes as BPS-state sums']. \n",
      " Abstract : [\"  Recently, we introduced a new procedure for computing a class of one-loop\\nBPS-saturated amplitudes in String Theory, which expresses them as a sum of\\none-loop contributions of all perturbative BPS states in a manifestly T-duality\\ninvariant fashion. In this paper, we extend this procedure to all BPS-saturated\\namplitudes of the form \\\\int_F \\\\Gamma_{d+k,d} {\\\\Phi}, with {\\\\Phi} being a weak\\n(almost) holomorphic modular form of weight -k/2. We use the fact that any such\\n{\\\\Phi} can be expressed as a linear combination of certain absolutely\\nconvergent Poincar\\\\'e series, against which the fundamental domain F can be\\nunfolded. The resulting BPS-state sum neatly exhibits the singularities of the\\namplitude at points of gauge symmetry enhancement, in a chamber-independent\\nfashion. We illustrate our method with concrete examples of interest in\\nheterotic string compactifications.\\n\"]. \n",

For example, a gluon propagator of the Gribov type,\\n$\\\\frac{k^2}{k^4+{\\\\hat \\\\gamma}^4}$, can be viewed as a propagating pair of\\nunphysical modes, called here $i$-particles, with complex masses $\\\\pm i{\\\\hat\\n\\\\gamma}^2$.

We introduce a simple toy model describing how a suitable set\\nof composite operators can be constructed out of $i$-particles whose\\ncorrelation functions exhibit only real branch cuts, with associated positive\\nspectral density. These composite operators can thus be called physical and are\\nthe toy analogy of glueballs in the Gribov-Zwanziger theory.\\n']. \n",

      " Abstract : ['  We study the effect of spontaneous breaking of Lorentz invariance on black\\nhole thermodynamics. We consider a scenario where Lorentz symmetry breaking\\nmanifests itself by the difference of maximal velocities attainable by\\nparticles of different species in a preferred reference frame. The Lorentz\\nbreaking sector is represented by the ghost condensate. We find that the\\nnotions of black hole entropy and temperature loose their universal meaning. In\\nparticular, the standard derivation of the Hawking radiation yields that a\\nblack hole does emit thermal radiation in any given particle species, but with\\ntemperature depending on the maximal attainable velocity of this species. We\\ndemonstrate that this property implies violation of the second law of\\nthermodynamics, and hence, allows construction of a perpetuum mobile of the 2nd\\nkind.

In arXiv:1407.7249 it was derived that the sphere\\nis a local extremum, by showing that the contribution linear in the deformation\\nparameter is absent. In this paper I demonstrate that the quadratic\\ncontribution is positive and is controlled by the coefficient of the stress\\ntensor two point function, $C_T$. Such a minimization result contextualizes the\\nfruitful relation between the EE of a sphere and the number of degrees of\\nfreedom in field theory. I work with CFTs with gravitational duals, where all\\nhigher curvature couplings are turned on. These couplings parametrize conformal\\nstructures in stress tensor $n$-point functions, hence I show the result for\\ninfinitely many CFT examples.\\n']. \n",

We show that by studying the quadratic fluctuations around such\\nbackgrounds it is possible to derive the 4-point correlators of two light and\\ntwo heavy states in the supergravity approximation. We provide an explicit\\nexample in the AdS$_3$ setup relevant for the duality with the D1-D5 CFT.\\nContrary to previously studied examples, the supergravity correlator derived in\\nthis work differs from the result obtained at the CFT orbifold point. Our\\nmethod bypasses the difficulties of applying the standard Witten's diagrams\\napproach to correlators with operators of large conformal dimension and also\\navoids some technical steps that have made the computation of dynamical 4-point\\ncorrelators in the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ context unfeasible until now.\\n\"]. \n",

The\\nright hand side of this OPE contains the spin-6 Casimir current which is also a\\ngenerator of WD_4 coset minimal model. Based on this N=8 result, we generalize\\nthe above OPE for the general N(in the WD_{N/2} coset minimal model) by using\\ntwo N-generalized coupling constants initiated by Hornfeck sometime ago: the\\nsimplest OPE for the lowest higher spin currents. We also analyze the similar\\nOPE in the WB_3(and WB_{(N-1)/2}) coset minimal model with SO(7) current\\nalgebra. The large N 't Hooft limits are discussed. Our results in two\\ndimensional conformal field theory provide the asymptotic symmetry, at the\\nquantum level, of the higher spin AdS_3 gravity found by Chen et al.\\n\"]. \n",

We model the microstates of the black hole in terms\\nof a field theory living on an end of the world brane behind the horizon, and\\nallow this field theory to itself have a holographic dual geometry. This\\ngeometry is also a black hole since entanglement of the microstates with the\\nradiation leaves them in a mixed state. This \"inception black hole\" can be\\npurified by entanglement through a wormhole with an auxiliary system which is\\nnaturally identified with the external radiation, giving a realization of the\\nER=EPR scenario. In this context, we propose an extension of the Ryu-Takayanagi\\n(RT) formula, in which extremal surfaces computing entanglement entropy are\\nallowed to pass through the brane into its dual geometry. This new rule\\nreproduces the Page curve for evaporating black holes, consistently with the\\nrecently proposed \"island formula\". We then separate the radiation system into\\npieces. Our extended RT rule shows that the entanglement wedge of the union of\\nradiation subsystems covers the black hole interior at late times, but the\\nunion of entanglement wedges of the subsystems may not. This result points to a\\nsecret sharing scheme in Hawking radiation wherein reconstruction of certain\\nregions in the interior is impossible with any subsystem of the radiation, but\\npossible with all of it.\\n']. \n",

For two\\nsub-systems separated by a surface the entanglement entropy is proportional to\\nthe area of the surface and depends on the UV cutoff which regulates the\\nshort-distance correlations. The geometrical nature of the entanglement entropy\\ncalculation is particularly intriguing when applied to black holes when the\\nentangling surface is the black hole horizon. I review a variety of aspects of\\nthis calculation: the useful mathematical tools such as the geometry of spaces\\nwith conical singularities and the heat kernel method, the UV divergences in\\nthe entropy and their renormalization, the logarithmic terms in the\\nentanglement entropy in 4 and 6 dimensions and their relation to the conformal\\nanomalies. The focus in the review is on the systematic use of the conical\\nsingularity method. The relations to other known approaches such as 't Hooft's\\nbrick wall model and the Euclidean path integral in the optical metric are\\ndiscussed in detail. The puzzling behavior of the entanglement entropy due to\\nfields which non-minimally couple to gravity is emphasized. The holographic\\ndescription of the entanglement entropy of the black hole horizon is\\nillustrated on the two- and four-dimensional examples. Finally, I examine the\\npossibility to interpret the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy entirely as the\\nentanglement entropy.\\n\"]. \n",

This thesis explores some proposed connections between\\nentanglement entropy and the geometry of spacetime. One such connection is the\\nability to derive gravitational field equations from entanglement identities. I\\nwill discuss a specific derivation of the Einstein equation from an equilibrium\\ncondition satisfied by entanglement entropy, and explore a subtlety in the\\nconstruction when the matter fields are not conformally invariant. As a further\\ngeneralization, I extend the argument to include higher curvature theories of\\ngravity, whose consideration is necessitated by the presence of subleading\\ndivergences in the entanglement entropy beyond the area law.\\n  A deeper issue in this construction, as well as in more general\\nconsiderations identifying black hole entropy with entanglement entropy, is\\nthat the entropy is ambiguous for gauge fields and gravitons. The ambiguity\\nstems from how one handles edge modes at the entangling surface, which\\nparameterize the gauge transformations that are broken by the presence of the\\nboundary. The final part of this thesis is devoted to identifying the edge\\nmodes in arbitrary diffeomorphism-invariant theories.

This entanglement entropy is obtained by\\nembedding the physical Hilbert space into a product of Hilbert spaces\\nassociated to regions with boundary. The latter Hilbert spaces include degrees\\nof freedom on the entangling surface that transform like surface charges under\\nthe gauge symmetry. These degrees of freedom are shown to contribute to the\\nentanglement entropy, and the form of this contribution is determined by the\\ngauge symmetry. We test our definition using the example of two-dimensional\\nYang-Mills theory, and find that it agrees with the thermal entropy in de\\nSitter space, and with the results of the Euclidean replica trick.

It\\nis interesting to ask if there is also an information theoretic interpretation\\nof the areas of non-extremal surfaces that are not necessarily\\nboundary-anchored. In general, the physics outside such surfaces is associated\\nto observers restricted to a time-strip in the dual boundary field theory. When\\nthe latter is two-dimensional, it is known that the differential entropy\\nassociated to the strip computes the length of the dual bulk curve, and has an\\ninterpretation in terms of the information cost in Bell pairs of restoring\\ncorrelations inaccessible to observers in the strip. A general realization of\\nthis formalism in higher dimensions is unknown.

Then we propose a new formula in terms of an\\nintegral of shape derivatives of the entanglement entropy of ball shaped\\nregions. Our proposal stems from the physical requirement that differential\\nentropy must be locally finite and conformally invariant.

      " Abstract : ['  When absorbing boundary conditions are used to evaporate a black hole in\\nAdS/CFT, we show that there is a phase transition in the location of the\\nquantum Ryu-Takayanagi surface, at precisely the Page time. The new RT surface\\nlies slightly inside the event horizon, at an infalling time approximately the\\nscrambling time $\\\\beta/2\\\\pi \\\\log S_{BH}$ into the past. We can immediately\\nderive the Page curve, using the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, and the\\nHayden-Preskill decoding criterion, using entanglement wedge reconstruction.\\nBecause part of the interior is now encoded in the early Hawking radiation, the\\ndecreasing entanglement entropy of the black hole is exactly consistent with\\nthe semiclassical bulk entanglement of the late-time Hawking modes, despite the\\nabsence of a firewall.\\n  By studying the entanglement wedge of highly mixed states, we can understand\\nthe state dependence of the interior reconstructions. A crucial role is played\\nby the existence of tiny, non-perturbative errors in entanglement wedge\\nreconstruction.

Using the dual gravity description, we\\ncheck that in two spacetime dimensions the impurity entropy does not depend on\\na particular state of the theory, which is a well-known CFT result. In three\\ndimensions different, and not necessarily equivalent, definitions of the defect\\nentropy can be given.

The results indicate that the entanglement entropy\\nflows to the definition of the entropy as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy\\nassociated to a portion of the black horizon, which we call impurity \"shadow\".\\nGeometric configurations, which we discuss, provide examples of RG flows of the\\ndefect entropies.

Once\\nthe relevant correlations are encoded, i.e. if the algebra is sufficiently\\nenlarged, perfect state distinguishability becomes possible. We arrive at this\\nby computing the von Neumann entropy which may explain the result obtained by\\napplying the quantum extremal surface prescription to the mixed state. We then\\nexamine these insights in the context of black hole evaporation and argue that\\ninformation is transferred to the radiation via black hole intertwiners. We\\nderive the Page curve. The mechanism above suggests that black hole information\\nis topologically protected. An infalling observer would experience no drama.\\nThis may resolve the unitarity problem without running into any firewall or\\nstate puzzle, the latter being evident in generalized entropy computations. We\\nalso examine the question of how certain wormhole topologies may be understood\\ngiven these findings.

We\\ncompute entanglement entropy in a variety of holographic systems, paying\\nparticular attention to its long-distance behaviour, characterised by a term\\nproportional to surface area. This term is known to decrease along\\nLorentz-invariant renormalisation group flows, suggesting that it may count\\nmassless degrees of freedom. We find that more general deformations may\\nincrease this area term, possibly indicating an enhanced number of\\nlong-distance degrees of freedom. We observe a correlation between this\\nenhancement and the emergence of new scaling symmetry at long distances. Next,\\nwe study the spectrum of collective excitations in a holographic model of a\\nnon-Fermi liquid. At high temperatures, the spectrum of collective excitations\\nincludes hydrodynamic sound waves. As in similar models, we observe that\\nsound-like modes also exist at low temperatures. Such modes are known as\\nholographic zero sound. We study the changing properties of holographic zero\\nsound and the emergence of hydrodynamic behaviour at high temperatures as we\\nvary the parameters of the model. We find that for certain values of the\\nparameters, the temperature-dependence of holographic zero sound qualitatively\\nresembles that of a normal Fermi liquid. Finally, we study the entanglement\\nentropy contribution of surface defects in a six-dimensional quantum field\\ntheory of relevance to M-theory, which is a candidate theory of quantum\\ngravity. We find that the entanglement entropy does not montonically decrease\\nalong renormalisation group flows on these defects, ruling it out as a\\npotential measure of degrees of freedom. On the other hand, we find that two of\\nthe contributions of the defect to the Weyl anomaly of the quantum field theory\\ndecrease along all of the flows that we study.\\n'] \n",

However, in some systems entanglement can be dominated by\\n\"internal\", possibly gauged, degrees of freedom that are not spatially\\norganized, and that can give rise to gaps smaller than the inverse size of the\\nsystem. In a holographic context, such small gaps are associated to the\\nappearance of horizons and singularities in the dual spacetime. Here, we\\npropose a concept of entwinement, which is intended to capture this fine\\nstructure of the wavefunction. Holographically, entwinement probes the\\nentanglement shadow -- the region of spacetime not probed by the minimal\\nsurfaces that compute spatial entanglement in the dual field theory. We\\nconsider the simplest example of this scenario -- a 2d conformal field theory\\n(CFT) that is dual to a conical defect in AdS3 space. Following our previous\\nwork, we show that spatial entanglement in the CFT reproduces spacetime\\ngeometry up to a finite distance from the conical defect. We then show that the\\ninterior geometry up to the defect can be reconstructed from entwinement that\\nis sensitive to the discretely gauged, fractionated degrees of freedom of the\\nCFT. Entwinement in the CFT is related to non-minimal geodesics in the conical\\ndefect geometry, suggesting a potential quantum information theoretic meaning\\nfor these objects in a holographic context.

This conjecture is motivated by a\\ngeneralization to strings of the rule for computing anomalous dimensions of\\nmassive particles and supergravity fields in the anti-de Sitter space. We show\\nthat this proportionality holds for a rotating closed string in global AdS\\nspace, representing a high spin operator made of fields in the adjoint\\nrepresentation. It is also valid for closed strings rotating in $S^5$\\n(representing operators with large R-charge), for closed strings with multiple\\nAdS spin, and for giant magnons. Based on this conjecture, we calculate the\\nanomalous dimension $\\\\delta$ of operators made of fields in the fundamental\\nrepresentation, associated with high spin mesons, and which are represented by\\nrotating open strings attached to probe D7-branes. The result is a logarithmic\\ndependence upon the spin, $\\\\delta\\\\sim \\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda}\\\\ln S$, similar to the\\nclosed string case. We show that the operator properties --- anomalous\\ndimension and spin --- are obtained from measurements made by a local observer\\nin the anti-de Sitter space.

In contrast, properties of the\\ngauge theory states, like the energy, correspond to measurements by a gauge\\ntheory observer and depend upon the mass scale --- once again, as expected.\\n']. \n",

      " Abstract : ['  Motivated by the problem of the evolution of bulk gravitational waves in\\nRandall-Sundrum cosmology, we develop a characteristic numerical scheme to\\nsolve 1+1 dimensional wave equations in the presence of a moving timelike\\nboundary. The scheme exhibits quadratic convergence, is capable of handling\\narbitrary brane trajectories, and is easily extendible to non-AdS bulk\\ngeometries. We use our method to contrast two different prescriptions for the\\nbulk fluctuation initial conditions found in the literature; namely, those of\\nHiramatsu et al. (hep-th/0410247) and Ichiki and Nakamura (astro-ph/0406606).\\nWe find that if the initial data surface is set far enough in the past, the\\nlate time waveform on the brane is insensitive to the choice between the two\\npossibilities; and we present numeric and analytic evidence that this\\nphenomenon generalizes to more generic initial data. Observationally, the main\\nconsequence of this work is to re-affirm previous claims that the stochastic\\ngravitational wave spectrum is predominantly flat, in contradiction with naive\\npredictions from the effective 4-dimensional theory. Furthermore, this flat\\nspectrum result is predicted to be robust against uncertainties in (or\\nmodifications of) the bulk initial data, provided that the energy scale of\\nbrane inflation is high enough.\\n']. \n",

      " Abstract : ['  Wilson lines capture important features of scattering amplitudes, for example\\nsoft effects relevant for infrared divergences, and the Regge limit. Beyond the\\nleading power approximation, corrections to the eikonal picture have to be\\ntaken into account. In this paper, we study such corrections in a model of\\nmassive scattering amplitudes in N = 4 super Yang-Mills, in the planar limit,\\nwhere the mass is generated through a Higgs mechanism. Using known three-loop\\nanalytic expressions for the scattering amplitude, we find that the first power\\nsuppressed term has a very simple form, equal to a single power law. We propose\\nthat its exponent is governed by the anomalous dimension of a Wilson loop with\\na scalar inserted at the cusp, and we provide perturbative evidence for this\\nproposal. We also analyze other limits of the amplitude and conjecture an exact\\nformula for a total cross-section at high energies.\\n']. \n",

      " Abstract : ['  We clarify and further explore the CFT dual of shockwave geometries in\\nAnti-de Sitter. The shockwave is dual to a CFT state produced by a heavy local\\noperator inserted at a complex point. It can also be created by light\\noperators, smeared over complex positions. We describe the dictionary in both\\ncases, and compare to various calculations, old and new. In CFT, we analyze the\\noperator product expansion in the Regge limit, and find that the leading\\ncontribution is exactly the shockwave operator, $\\\\int du h_{uu}$, localized on\\na bulk geodesic. For heavy sources this is a simple consequence of conformal\\ninvariance, but for light operators it involves a smearing procedure that\\nprojects out certain double-trace contributions to the OPE. We revisit\\ncausality constraints in large-$N$ CFT from this perspective, and show that the\\nchaos bound in CFT coincides with a bulk condition proposed by Engelhardt and\\nFischetti. In particular states, this reproduces known constraints on CFT\\n3-point couplings, and confirms some assumptions about double-trace operators\\nmade in previous work.\\n']. \n",

      " Abstract : ['  We develop the idea of an effective conformal theory describing the low-lying\\nspectrum of the dilatation operator in a CFT. Such an effective theory is\\nuseful when the spectrum contains a hierarchy in the dimension of operators,\\nand a small parameter whose role is similar to that of 1/N in a large N gauge\\ntheory. These criteria insure that there is a regime where the dilatation\\noperator is modified perturbatively. Global AdS is the natural framework for\\nperturbations of the dilatation operator respecting conformal invariance, much\\nas Minkowski space naturally describes Lorentz invariant perturbations of the\\nHamiltonian. Assuming that the lowest-dimension single-trace operator is a\\nscalar, O, we consider the anomalous dimensions, gamma(n,l), of the\\ndouble-trace operators of the form O (del^2)^n (del)^l O. Purely from the CFT\\nwe find that perturbative unitarity places a bound on these dimensions of\\n|gamma(n,l)|<4. Non-renormalizable AdS interactions lead to violations of the\\nbound at large values of n. We also consider the case that these interactions\\nare generated by integrating out a heavy scalar field in AdS. We show that the\\npresence of the heavy field \"unitarizes\" the growth in the anomalous\\ndimensions, and leads to a resonance-like behavior in gamma(n,l) when n is\\nclose to the dimension of the CFT operator dual to the heavy field. Finally, we\\ndemonstrate that bulk flat-space S-matrix elements can be extracted from the\\nlarge n behavior of the anomalous dimensions. This leads to a direct connection\\nbetween the spectrum of anomalous dimensions in d-dimensional CFTs and\\nflat-space S-matrix elements in d+1 dimensions.
