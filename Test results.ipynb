The first approach is an analysis of the\\nhigh-energy regime of quantum gravity in the eikonal approximation, where the\\ntheory reduces to a topological field theory. This is the regime where\\nparticles interact at high energies but with small momentum transfer. We do\\nthis for the cases of asymptotically dS and AdS geometries and find that in\\nboth cases the theory is topological. We discuss the relation of our solutions\\nin AdS to those of Horowitz and Itzhaki. We also consider quantum gravity away\\nfrom the extreme eikonal limit and explain the sense in which the covariance of\\nthe theory is equivalent to taking into account transfer of momentum. The\\nsecond approach we pursue is the AdS/CFT correspondence. We provide a\\nholographic reconstruction of the bulk space-time metric and of bulk fields on\\nthis space-time, out of conformal field theory data. Knowing which sources are\\nturned on is sufficient in order to obtain an asymptotic expansion of the bulk\\nmetric and of bulk fields near the boundary to high enough order so that all\\ninfrared divergences of the on-shell action are obtained. We provide explicit\\nformulae for the holographic stress-energy tensors associated with an arbitrary\\nasymptotically AdS geometry. We also study warped compactifications, where our\\nd-dimensional world is regarded as a slice of a (d+1)-dimensional space-time,\\nand analyse in detail the question as to where the d-dimensional observer can\\nfind the information about the extra dimension.\\n']. \n",

We show that there exist constraints which arise in the\\nquantization of the scalar field theory on AdS which cannot be reproduced\\nthrough the usual AdS/CFT prescription. We argue that the usual energy, defined\\nthrough the stress-energy tensor, is not the natural one to be considered in\\nthe context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We analyze a new definition of the\\nenergy which makes use of the Noether current corresponding to time\\ndisplacements in global coordinates. We compute the new energy for Dirichlet,\\nNeumann and mixed boundary conditions on the scalar field and for both the\\nminimally and non-minimally coupled cases. Then, we perform the quantization of\\nthe scalar field theory on AdS showing that, for `regular' and `irregular'\\nmodes, the new energy is conserved, positive and finite. We show that the\\nquantization gives rise, in a natural way, to a generalized AdS/CFT\\nprescription which maps to the boundary all the information contained in the\\nbulk. In particular, we show that the divergent local terms of the on-shell\\naction contain information about the Legendre transformed generating\\nfunctional, and that the new constraints for which the irregular modes\\npropagate in the bulk are the same constraints for which such divergent local\\nterms cancel out. In this situation, the addition of counterterms is not\\nrequired. We also show that there exist particular cases for which the\\nunitarity bound is reached, and the conformal dimension becomes independent of\\nthe effective mass.

      " Abstract : [\"  We consider gravity in three dimensions with an arbitrary number of curvature\\ncorrections. We show that such corrections are always functions of only three\\nindependent curvature invariants. Demanding the existence of a holographic\\nc-theorem we show how to fix the coefficients in the action for an arbitrarily\\nhigh order, recovering the new massive gravity lagrangian at quadratic order.\\nWe calculate the central charge $c$ and show that using Cardy's formula it\\nmatches the entropy of black hole solutions, which we construct. We also\\nconsider fluctuations about an AdS background, and find that it is possible to\\nobtain two derivative equations by imposing a single constraint, thereby\\nlifting the pathologic massive modes of new massive gravity. If we do not\\nimpose this, there is a set of ghosty massive modes propagating in the bulk.\\nHowever, at $c=0$ these become massless and it is expected that these theories\\nencode the dynamics of the spin two sector of strongly coupled logarithmic\\nCFT's.\\n\"]. \n",

      " Abstract : ['  One of explanations of the black hole entropy implies that gravity is\\nentirely induced by quantum effects. By using arguments based on the AdS/CFT\\ncorrespondence we give induced gravity interpretation of the gravity in a brane\\nworld in higher dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. The underlying quantum\\ntheory is SU(N) theory where $N$ is related to the CFT central charge. The\\ntheory includes massless fields which correspond to degrees of freedom of the\\nboundary CFT. In addition, on the brane there are massive degrees of freedom\\nwith masses proportional to $l^{-1}$ where $l$ is the radius of AdS. At the\\nconformal boundary of AdS they are infinitely heavy and completely decouple. It\\nis the massive fields which can explain the black hole entropy. We support our\\ninterpretation by a microscopic model of a 2D brane world in $AdS_3$.\\n']. \n",

      " Abstract : ['  We analytically calculate the quasi-normal modes of various perturbations of\\nspacelike stretched and null warped $AdS_3$ black holes. From AdS/CFT\\ncorrespondence, these quasi-normal modes are expected to appear as the poles in\\nmomentum space of retarded Green functions of dual operators in CFT at finite\\ntemperature. We find that this is indeed the case, after taking into account of\\nthe subtle identification of quantum numbers. The subtlety comes from the fact\\nthat only after appropriate coordinate transformation the asymptotic geometries\\nof warped black holes are the same as the ones of warped $AdS_3$ spacetimes. We\\nshow that in general the quasi-normal modes are in good agreement with the\\nprediction of the warped AdS/CFT correspondence, up to a constant factor. As a\\nbyproduct, we compute the conformal dimensions of boundary operators dual to\\nthe perturbations. Our result gives strong support to the conjectured warped\\nAdS/CFT correspondence.\\n']. \n",

As a result,\\nwhether a given bulk operator can be reconstructed on the boundary at all can\\ndepend on whether the black hole is described by a pure state or thermal\\nensemble. We refine this dichotomy, demonstrating that the same boundary\\noperator can often be used for large subspaces of black hole microstates,\\ncorresponding to a constant fraction $\\\\alpha$ of the black hole entropy. In the\\nSchrodinger picture, the boundary subregion encodes the $\\\\alpha$-bits (a\\nconcept from quantum information) of a bulk region containing the black hole\\nand bounded by extremal surfaces.

Firstly, they imply that\\nthe bulk reconstruction is necessarily only approximate and allow us to place\\nnon-perturbative lower bounds on the error when doing so. Second, they provide\\na simple and tractable limit in which the entanglement wedge is\\nstate-dependent, but in a highly controlled way.

      " Abstract : ['  Most of the literature in the \\\\emph{bulk reconstruction program} in\\nholography focuses on recovering local bulk operators propagating on a\\nquasilocal bulk geometry and the knowledge of the bulk geometry is always\\nassumed or guessed. The fundamental problem of the bulk reconstruction program,\\nwhich is \\\\emph{recovering the bulk background geometry (metric)} from the\\nboundary CFT state is still outstanding. In this work, we formulate a recipe to\\nextract the bulk metric itself from the boundary state, specifically, the\\nmodular Hamiltonian information of spherical subregions in the boundary. Our\\nrecipe exploits the recent construction of Kabat and Lifschytz\\n\\\\cite{Kabat:2017mun} to first compute the bulk two point function of scalar\\nfields directly in the CFT without knowledge of the bulk metric or the\\nequations of motion, and then to take a large scaling dimension limit (WKB) to\\nextract the geodesic distance between two close points in the bulk i.e. the\\nmetric. As a proof of principle, we consider three dimensional bulk and\\nselected CFT states such as the vacuum and the thermofield double states. We\\nshow that they indeed reproduce the pure AdS and the regions outside the\\nRindler wedge and the BTZ black hole \\\\emph{up to a rigid conformal factor}.\\nSince our approach does not rely on symmetry properties of the CFT state, it\\ncan be applied to reconstruct asymptotically AdS geometries dual to arbitrary\\ngeneral CFT states provided the modular Hamiltonian is available.

The earliest and most striking example of the\\ncorrespondence is the conjectured duality between the energy spectrum of type\\nIIB superstring theory on AdS_5 x S^5 and the operator anomalous dimensions of\\nN=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. While there is a\\nsubstantial amount of evidence in support of this conjecture, direct tests have\\nbeen elusive. The difficulty of quantizing superstring theory in a curved\\nRamond-Ramond background is compounded by the problem of computing anomalous\\ndimensions for non-BPS operators in the strongly coupled regime of the gauge\\ntheory. The former problem can be circumvented to some extent by taking a\\nPenrose limit of AdS_5 x S^5, reducing the background to that of a pp-wave\\n(where the string theory is soluble). A corresponding limit of the gauge theory\\nwas discovered by Berenstein, Maldacena and Nastase, who obtained successful\\nagreement between a class of operator dimensions in this limit and\\ncorresponding string energies in the Penrose limit. In this dissertation we\\npresent a body of work based largely on the introduction of worldsheet\\ninteraction corrections to the free pp-wave string theory by lifting the\\nPenrose limit of AdS_5 x S^5. This provides a new class of rigorous tests of\\nAdS/CFT that probe a truly quantum realm of the string theory.

First, we show how to describe these configurations in the CFT\\nside using a matrix model. In this picture, giant gravitons are realized as\\nsingle excitations high above a Fermi sea, or as deep holes into it. Then, we\\ngive a prescription to define quasi-classical states and we recover the known\\nclassical solution associated to the CFT dual of a giant graviton that grows in\\nAdS. Second, we use the AdS/CFT dictionary to obtain the supergravity boundary\\nstress tensor of a general state and to holographically reconstruct the bulk\\nmetric, obtaining the back reaction of space-time. We find that the space-time\\nresponse to all the supersymmetric giant graviton states is of the same form,\\nproducing the singular BPS limit of the three charge Reissner-Nordstr\\\\\"om-AdS\\nblack holes. While computing the boundary stress tensor, we comment on the\\nfinite counterterm recently introduced by Liu and Sabra, and connect it to a\\nscheme-dependent conformal anomaly.\\n']. \n",

      " Abstract : ['  The existence of quantum error correcting codes is one of the most\\ncounterintuitive and potentially technologically important discoveries of\\nquantum information theory. However, standard error correction refers to\\nabstract quantum information, i.e., information that is independent of the\\nphysical incarnation of the systems used for storing the information. There\\nare, however, other forms of information that are physical - one of the most\\nubiquitous being reference frame information. Here we analyze the problem of\\nerror correcting physical information. The basic question we seek to answer is\\nwhether or not such error correction is possible and, if so, what limitations\\ngovern the process. The main challenge is that the systems used for\\ntransmitting physical information, in addition to any actions applied to them,\\nmust necessarily obey these limitations. Encoding and decoding operations that\\nobey a restrictive set of limitations need not exist a priori. We focus on the\\ncase of erasure errors, and we first show that the problem is equivalent to\\nquantum error correction using group-covariant encodings. We prove a no-go\\ntheorem showing that that no finite dimensional, group-covariant quantum codes\\nexist for Lie groups with an infinitesimal generator (e.g., U(1), SU(2), and\\nSO(3)). We then explain how one can circumvent this no-go theorem using\\ninfinite dimensional codes, and we give an explicit example of a covariant\\nquantum error correcting code using continuous variables for the group U(1).\\nFinally, we demonstrate that all finite groups have finite dimensional codes,\\ngiving both an explicit construction and a randomized approximate construction\\nwith exponentially better parameters.\\n']. \n",

This question can be answered by\\nappealing to the quantum error correcting properties of holography, and it was\\nrecently shown that robust bulk (entanglement wedge) reconstruction can be\\nachieved using a universal recovery channel known as the twirled Petz map. In\\nshort, one can use the twirled Petz map to recover bulk data from a subset of\\nthe boundary. However, this map involves an averaging procedure over bulk and\\nboundary modular time, and hence it can be somewhat intractable to evaluate in\\npractice. We show that a much simpler channel, the Petz map, is sufficient for\\nentanglement wedge reconstruction for any code space of fixed finite dimension\\n- no twirling is required. Moreover, the error in the reconstruction will\\nalways be non-perturbatively small.

      " Abstract : [\"  We apply and extend the theory of universal recovery channels from quantum\\ninformation theory to address the problem of entanglement wedge reconstruction\\nin AdS/CFT. It has recently been proposed that any low-energy local bulk\\noperators in a CFT boundary region's entanglement wedge can be reconstructed on\\nthat boundary region itself. Existing work arguing for this proposal relies on\\nalgebraic consequences of the exact equivalence between bulk and boundary\\nrelative entropies, namely the theory of operator algebra quantum error\\ncorrection. However, bulk and boundary relative entropies are only\\napproximately equal in bulk effective field theory, and in similar situations\\nit is known that predictions from exact entropic equalities can be\\nqualitatively incorrect. The framework of universal recovery channels provides\\na robust demonstration of the entanglement wedge reconstruction conjecture in\\naddition to new physical insights. Most notably, we find that a bulk operator\\nacting in a given boundary region's entanglement wedge can be expressed as the\\nresponse of the boundary region's modular Hamiltonian to a perturbation of the\\nbulk state in the direction of the bulk operator. This formula can be\\ninterpreted as a noncommutative version of Bayes' rule that attempts to undo\\nthe noise induced by restricting to only a portion of the boundary, and has an\\nintegral representation in terms of modular flows. To reach these conclusions,\\nwe extend the theory of universal recovery channels to finite-dimensional\\noperator algebras and demonstrate that recovery channels approximately preserve\\nthe multiplicative structure of the operator algebra.\\n\"]. \n",

The entanglement entropy can be\\noperationalized as the entanglement cost necessary to transmit the state of the\\nsubregion from one party to another while preserving all correlations with a\\nreference party. The question then arises as to whether the lengths of other\\nbulk curves can be interpreted as entanglement costs for some other information\\ntheoretic tasks. Building on recent results showing that the length of more\\ngeneral bulk curves is computed by the differential entropy, we introduce a new\\ntask called constrained state merging, whereby the state of the boundary\\nsubregion must be transmitted using operations restricted in location and scale\\nin a way determined by the geometry of the bulk curve. Our main result is that\\nthe cost to transmit the state of a subregion under the conditions of\\nconstrained state merging is given by the differential entropy and hence the\\nsigned length of the corresponding bulk curve. When the cost is negative,\\nconstrained state merging distills entanglement rather than consuming it. This\\ndemonstration has two parts: first, we exhibit a protocol whose cost is the\\nlength of the curve and second, we prove that this protocol is optimal in that\\nit uses the minimum amount of entanglement. In order to complete the proof, we\\nadditionally demonstrate that single-shot smooth conditional entropies for\\nintervals in 1+1-dimensional conformal field theories with large central charge\\nare well approximated by their von Neumann counterparts.

      " Abstract : ['  We consider the time evolution of mixed state correlation measures in\\ntwo-dimensional conformal field theories, such as logarithmic negativity, odd\\nentropy, and reflected entropy, after quantum quenches of various kinds. These\\ncorrelation measures, in the holographic context, are all associated to the\\nentanglement wedge cross section. We contrast various classes of conformal\\nfield theories, both rational and irrational (pure) conformal field theories.\\nFirst, for rational conformal field theories, whose dynamics can be well\\ndescribed by the quasi-particle picture, we find all four quantities for\\ndisjoint intervals to be proportional, regardless of the specific quench\\nprotocol. Second, using the light cone bootstrap, we generalize our results to\\nirrational conformal field theories where we find sharp distinctions from the\\nquasi-particle results and striking differences between mutual information and\\nthe other measures. The large surplus of logarithmic negativity relative to\\nmutual information forces us to reconsider what mutual information and\\nlogarithmic negativity really measure. We interpret these results as a\\nsignature of information scrambling and chaos in irrational theories. These CFT\\nresults perfectly agree with our gravitational (holographic) calculations.\\nFurthermore, using holography, we are able to generalize the results to outside\\nof the light cone limit. Finally, due to the breakdown of the quasi-particle\\npicture for irrational theories, we appeal to the \"line-tension picture,\"\\nmotivated by random unitary circuits, as a phenomenological description. We\\nobserve that random unitary circuits, with local Hilbert space dimension\\ndetermined by the Cardy formula, have precisely the same entanglement dynamics\\nas irrational (including holographic) conformal field theories.\\n']. \n",

When\\nthe latter is two-dimensional, it is known that the differential entropy\\nassociated to the strip computes the length of the dual bulk curve, and has an\\ninterpretation in terms of the information cost in Bell pairs of restoring\\ncorrelations inaccessible to observers in the strip. A general realization of\\nthis formalism in higher dimensions is unknown. We first prove a no-go theorem\\neliminating candidate expressions for higher dimensional differential entropy\\nbased on entropic c-theorems. Then we propose a new formula in terms of an\\nintegral of shape derivatives of the entanglement entropy of ball shaped\\nregions. Our proposal stems from the physical requirement that differential\\nentropy must be locally finite and conformally invariant. Demanding\\ncancellation of the well-known UV divergences of entanglement entropy in field\\ntheory guides us to our conjecture, which we test for surfaces in $AdS_4$. Our\\nresults suggest a candidate c-function for field theories in arbitrary\\ndimensions.\\n']. \n",

The geometrical nature of the entanglement entropy\\ncalculation is particularly intriguing when applied to black holes when the\\nentangling surface is the black hole horizon. I review a variety of aspects of\\nthis calculation: the useful mathematical tools such as the geometry of spaces\\nwith conical singularities and the heat kernel method, the UV divergences in\\nthe entropy and their renormalization, the logarithmic terms in the\\nentanglement entropy in 4 and 6 dimensions and their relation to the conformal\\nanomalies. The focus in the review is on the systematic use of the conical\\nsingularity method. The relations to other known approaches such as 't Hooft's\\nbrick wall model and the Euclidean path integral in the optical metric are\\ndiscussed in detail. The puzzling behavior of the entanglement entropy due to\\nfields which non-minimally couple to gravity is emphasized.

One way to resolve the\\nparadox is to postulate the existence of a \"firewall\" inside the black hole\\nhorizon which prevents objects from falling smoothly toward the singularity. A\\nfundamental limitation on the behavior of quantum entanglement known as\\n\"monogamy\" plays a key role in the AMPS argument. Our goal is to study and\\napply many-body entanglement theory to consider the entanglement among\\ndifferent parts of Hawking radiation and black holes. Using the multipartite\\nentanglement measure called negativity, we identify an example which could\\nchange the AMPS accounting of quantum entanglement and perhaps eliminate the\\nneed for a firewall. Specifically, we constructed a toy model for black hole\\ndecay which has different entanglement behavior than that assumed by AMPS. We\\ndiscuss the additional steps that would be needed to bring lessons from our toy\\nmodel to our understanding of realistic black holes.\\n']. \n",

Our results closely parallel recent\\nobservations in AdS, and reproduce the Page curve. That there is a variation of\\nthe argument that can be phrased directly in flat space without reliance on\\nAdS, is a strong indication that entanglement wedge phase transitions may be\\nkey to the information paradox in flat space as well. Along the way, we give\\nevidence that the entanglement entropy of an ACD is a well-defined, and likely\\ninstructive, quantity.

This latter approach identifies an integral over the\\ncontinuum of normalizable states and a sum over an infinite tower of lighter\\ndiscrete states, whose contribution we extract by analytically continuing\\nstandard results to our HHLL setting. The sum over this tower reproduces the\\nsum over those complex saddlepoints of the path integral that contribute to the\\ncorrelator. Our path integral computations reveal that when the two light\\noperators are inserted at equal time in radial quantization, the leading-order\\nHHLL correlator is independent of their separation, and more generally that at\\nthis order there is no short-distance singularity as the two light operators\\napproach each other. The conformal block expansion likewise shows that in the\\ndiscrete sum short-distance singularities are indeed absent for all\\nintermediate states that contribute. In particular, the Virasoro vacuum block,\\nwhich would have been singular at short distances, is not exchanged. The\\nseparation-independence of equal-time correlators is due to cancelations\\nbetween the discrete contributions.

Restricting the current\\nconsideration to twist-two accuracy, we analyze two-particle contributions with\\na fermion as one of the constituents in the pair. We demonstrate that these\\nnonsinglet pentagons obey bootstrap equations that possess consistent solutions\\nfor any value of the coupling constant.

We develop techniques for\\ncomputing these, in a manner that sheds light on when and why one can expect\\nagreement between such quantities on each side of the duality. We set up the\\ncomputation of excited state R\\\\'enyi entropies in the bulk in terms of\\nChern-Simons connections, and show how this directly parallels the CFT\\ncomputation of correlation functions.

Using the properties of radially quantized conformal\\nfield theories and the operator-state correspondence, we glean information on\\nsome points. The Higuchi bound on the masses of spin-s states in de Sitter is a\\ndirect consequence of reflection positivity in radially quantized CFT$_3$ and\\nthe fact that scaling dimensions of operators are energies of states. The\\npartial massless states appearing in de Sitter correspond from the boundary\\nCFT$_3$ perspective to boundary states with highest weight for the conformal\\ngroup.

These models are numerically coarse grained via tensor network\\nrenormalization, allowing us to trace the flow of simplicity constraints to\\nlarger scales. In order to perform these simulations we have substantially\\nadapted tensor network algorithms, which we discuss in detail.\\n  The BC and the EPRL/FK model behave very differently under coarse graining:\\nWhile the unique BC intertwiner model is a fixed point and therefore\\nconstitutes a 2D topological phase, BC spin net models flow away from the\\ninitial simplicity constraints and converge to several different topological\\nphases. Most of these phases correspond to decoupling spin foam vertices,\\nhowever we find also a new phase in which this is not the case, and in which a\\nnon-trivial version of the simplicity constraints holds. The coarse graining\\nflow of the BC spin net models indicates furthermore that the phase transitions\\nare not of second order.

      " Abstract : ['  We discuss scattering in a CFT via the conformal partial-wave analysis and\\nthe Regge limit. The focus of this paper is on understanding an OPE with\\nMinkowski conformal blocks. Starting with a t-channel OPE, it leads to an\\nexpansion for an s-channel scattering amplitude in terms of t-channel\\nexchanges. By contrasting with Euclidean conformal blocks we see a precise\\nrelationship between conformal blocks in the two limits without preforming an\\nexplicit analytic continuation. We discuss a generic feature for a CFT\\ncorrelation function having singular $F^{(M)}(u,v)\\\\sim {u}^{-\\\\delta}\\\\,$,\\n$\\\\delta>0$, in the limit $u \\\\rightarrow 0$ and $v\\\\rightarrow 1$.

This bound is nearly saturated by\\nSYK-like effective $d=1$ CFT, and its stringy and thermal corrections have\\npiqued current interests. Our analysis has been facilitated by dealing with\\nWightman functions. We provide a direct treatment in diagonalizing dynamical\\nequations via harmonic analysis over physical scattering regions.

We analyse the\\nbehaviour of anomalous currents under RG flow to a conformal fixed point in\\nN=1, D=4 supersymmetric gauge theories. We prove that the anomalous dimension\\nof the Konishi current is related to the slope of the beta function at the\\ncritical point. We extend the duality map to the (nonchiral) Konishi current.\\nAs a byproduct we compute the slope of the beta function in the strong coupling\\nregime. We note that the OPE of $T_{\\\\mu\\\\nu}$ with itself does not close, but\\nmixes with a special additional operator $\\\\Sigma$ which in general is the\\nKonishi current. We discuss the implications of this fact in generic\\ninteracting conformal theories. In particular, a SCFT_4 seems to be naturally\\nequipped with a privileged off-critical deformation $\\\\Sigma$ and this allows us\\nto argue that electric-magnetic duality can be extended to a neighborhood of\\nthe critical point. We also stress that in SCFT_4 there are two central\\ncharges, c and c', associated with the stress tensor and $\\\\Sigma$,\\nrespectively; c and c' allow us to count both the vector multiplet and the\\nmatter multiplet effective degrees of freedom of the theory.\\n\"]. \n",

Such intertwining operators\\nare known to fulfill some operator identities---the intertwining relations---in\\nthe representation space of conformal algebra. Meanwhile, it has been known\\nthat the S-matrix operator in scattering theory is nothing but the intertwining\\noperator between the Hilbert spaces of in- and out-particles.
