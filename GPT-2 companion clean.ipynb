      " Abstract : [\"  The entanglement entropy in many gapless quantum systems receives a\\ncontribution from corners in the entangling surface in 2+1d. It is\\ncharacterized by a universal function $a(\\\\theta)$ depending on the opening\\nangle $\\\\theta$, and contains pertinent low energy information. For conformal\\nfield theories (CFTs), the leading expansion coefficient in the smooth limit\\n$\\\\theta \\\\to \\\\pi$ yields the stress tensor 2-point function coefficient $C_T$ .\\nLittle is known about $a(\\\\theta)$ beyond that limit. Here, we show that the\\nnext term in the smooth limit expansion contains information beyond the 2- and\\n3-point correlators of the stress tensor. We conjecture that it encodes 4-point\\ndata, making it much richer. Further, we establish strong constraints on this\\nand higher order smooth-limit coefficients. We also show that $a(\\\\theta)$ is\\nlower-bounded by a non-trivial function multiplied by the central charge $C_T$\\n, e.g. $a(\\\\pi/2) \\\\geq (\\\\pi^2 \\\\ln 2)C_T /6$. This bound for 90-degree corners is\\nnearly saturated by all known results, including recent numerics for the\\ninteracting Wilson-Fisher quantum critical points (QCPs).

A two-fold\\npuzzle appears in the extremal case, e.g. k_1 = k_2 + k_3.

An exact S-brane solution (either electric or magnetic) in a model\\nwith l scalar fields and one antisymmetric form of rank m > 1 is considered.\\nThis solution is defined on a product manifold containing n Ricci-flat factor\\nspaces M_1, ..., M_n. In the case when the kinetic term for scalar fields is\\npositive definite we singled out a special solution governed by the function\\ncosh.

We use a family of link modules over the periodic\\nTemperley-Lieb algebra EPTL_N(\\\\beta, \\\\alpha) introduced by Martin and Saleur,\\nand Graham and Lehrer. These are labeled by the numbers of sites N and of\\ndefects d, and extend the standard modules of the original Temperley-Lieb\\nalgebra. Beside the defining parameters \\\\beta=u^2+u^{-2} with u=e^{i\\\\lambda/2}\\n(weight of contractible loops) and \\\\alpha (weight of non-contractible loops),\\nthis family also depends on a twist parameter v that keeps track of how the\\ndefects wind around the cylinder.

The Gram determinant for the natural bilinear form on these link\\nmodules is shown to factorize in terms of an intertwiner i_N^d between these\\nlink representations and the eigenspaces of S^z of the XXZ models.

      " Abstract : ['  This paper discusses the formulation of the non-commutative Chern-Simons (CS)\\ntheory where the spatial slice, an infinite strip, is a manifold with\\nboundaries. As standard star products are not correct for such manifolds, the\\nstandard non-commutative CS theory is not also appropriate here. Instead we\\nformulate a new finite-dimensional matrix CS model as an approximation to the\\nCS theory on the strip. A work which has points of contact with ours is due to\\nLizzi, Vitale and Zampini where the authors obtain a description for the fuzzy\\ndisc. The gauge fields in our approach are operators supported on a subspace of\\nfinite dimension N+\\\\eta of the Hilbert space of eigenstates of a simple\\nharmonic oscillator with N, \\\\eta \\\\in Z^+ and N \\\\neq 0. This oscillator is\\nassociated with the underlying Moyal plane. The resultant matrix CS theory has\\na fuzzy edge. It becomes the required sharp edge when N and \\\\eta goes to\\ninfinity in a suitable sense. The non-commutative CS theory on the strip is\\ndefined by this limiting procedure. After performing the canonical constraint\\nanalysis of the matrix theory, we find that there are edge observables in the\\ntheory generating a Lie algebra with properties similar to that of a\\nnon-abelian Kac-Moody algebra. Our study shows that there are (\\\\eta+1)^2\\nabelian charges (observables) given by the matrix elements (\\\\cal A_i)_{N-1 N-1}\\nand (\\\\cal A_i)_{nm} (where n or m \\\\geq N) of the gauge fields, that obey\\ncertain standard canonical commutation relations. In addition, the theory\\ncontains three unique non-abelian charges, localized near the N^th level. We\\nshow that all non-abelian edge observables except these three can be\\nconstructed from the abelian charges above. Using the results of this analysis\\nwe discuss the large N and \\\\eta limit.\\n']. \n",

For two\\nsub-systems separated by a surface the entanglement entropy is proportional to\\nthe area of the surface and depends on the UV cutoff which regulates the\\nshort-distance correlations. The geometrical nature of the entanglement entropy\\ncalculation is particularly intriguing when applied to black holes when the\\nentangling surface is the black hole horizon. I review a variety of aspects of\\nthis calculation: the useful mathematical tools such as the geometry of spaces\\nwith conical singularities and the heat kernel method, the UV divergences in\\nthe entropy and their renormalization, the logarithmic terms in the\\nentanglement entropy in 4 and 6 dimensions and their relation to the conformal\\nanomalies. The focus in the review is on the systematic use of the conical\\nsingularity method. The relations to other known approaches such as 't Hooft's\\nbrick wall model and the Euclidean path integral in the optical metric are\\ndiscussed in detail. The puzzling behavior of the entanglement entropy due to\\nfields which non-minimally couple to gravity is emphasized. The holographic\\ndescription of the entanglement entropy of the black hole horizon is\\nillustrated on the two- and four-dimensional examples.

In the Rindler description of a (black hole)\\nhorizon, the relevant vacuum degrees of freedom manifest themselves as an extra\\nhidden quantum number carried by the states representing the second exterior\\nregion; this quantum number is invisible in the emergent quantum field theory.\\nIn a distant picture, these states arise as exponentially degenerate ground and\\nexcited states of the intrinsically quantum gravitational degrees of freedom on\\nthe stretched horizon. The formation and evaporation of a black hole involve\\nprocesses in which the entropy of collapsing matter is transformed into that of\\na vacuum and then to that of final-state Hawking radiation. In the intermediate\\nstage of this evolution, entanglement between the vacuum and (early) Hawking\\nradiation develops, which is transferred to the entanglement among final-state\\nHawking quanta through the evaporation process. The horizon is kept smooth\\nthroughout the evolution; in particular, no firewall develops. Similar\\nconsiderations also apply for cosmological horizons, for example for the\\nhorizon of a meta-stable de-Sitter space.\\n']. \n",

      " Abstract : ['  In this paper we review the AdS/BCFT proposal of T. Takayanagi for\\nholographic description of systems with boundaries, in particular, boundary\\nconformal field theories (BCFTs). Motivated by better understanding of the\\nproposed duality we employ entanglement entropy as a probe of familiar\\nproperties of impurities and defects. Using the dual gravity description, we\\ncheck that in two spacetime dimensions the impurity entropy does not depend on\\na particular state of the theory, which is a well-known CFT result. In three\\ndimensions different, and not necessarily equivalent, definitions of the defect\\nentropy can be given. We compute the entanglement entropy of a line defect at\\nfinite temperature and compare it with earlier calculations of the\\nthermodynamical entropy. The results indicate that the entanglement entropy\\nflows to the definition of the entropy as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy\\nassociated to a portion of the black horizon, which we call impurity \"shadow\".\\nGeometric configurations, which we discuss, provide examples of RG flows of the\\ndefect entropies. We outline the connection between the geometric picture of\\nthe RG flows and examples of lattice calculations. We also discuss some new\\ngeneralizations of the AdS/BCFT geometries.\\n']. \n",

      " Abstract : ['  The study of black hole physics revealed a fundamental connection between\\nthermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and gravity. Today, it is known that black\\nholes are thermodynamical objects with well-defined temperature and entropy.\\nAlthough black hole radiance gives us the mechanism from which we can associate\\na well-defined temperature to the black hole, the origin of its entropy remains\\na mystery. Here we investigate how the quantum fluctuations from the fields\\nthat render the black hole its temperature contribute to its entropy. By using\\nthe exact renormalization group equation for a self-interacting real scalar\\nfield in a spacetime possessing a bifurcate Killing horizon, we find the\\nrenormalization group flow of the total gravitational entropy. We show that\\nthroughout the flow one can split the quantum field contribution to the entropy\\ninto a part coming from the entanglement between field degrees of freedom\\ninside and outside the horizon and a part due to the quantum corrections to the\\nWald entropy coming from the Noether charge. The renormalized black hole\\nentropy is shown to be constant throughout the flow while the balance between\\nthe effective black hole entropy at low energies and the infra-red entanglement\\nentropy changes. A similar conclusion is valid for the Wald entropy part of the\\ntotal entropy. Additionally, our calculations show that there is no mismatch\\nbetween the renormalization of the coupling constants coming from the effective\\naction or the gravitational entropy, solving an apparent \"puzzle\" that appeared\\nto exist for interacting fields.\\n']. \n",

Unlike the case for $k\\\\geq2$, it turns out that the string\\nspectrum at $k=1$ does {\\\\it not} exhibit the long string continuum, and\\nperfectly matches with the large $N$ limit of the symmetric product. We also\\ndemonstrate that the fusion rules of the symmetric orbifold are reproduced from\\nthe worldsheet perspective. Our proposal therefore affords a tractable\\nworldsheet description of a tensionless limit in string theory, for which the\\ndual CFT is also explicitly known.\\n\"]. \n",

      " Abstract : ['  The dimer model on a strip is considered as a Yang-Baxter \\\\mbox{integrable}\\nsix vertex model at the free-fermion point with crossing parameter\\n$\\\\lambda=\\\\tfrac{\\\\pi}{2}$ and quantum group invariant boundary conditions. A\\none-to-many mapping of vertex onto dimer configurations allows for the solution\\nof the free-fermion model to be applied to the anisotropic dimer model on a\\nsquare lattice where the dimers are rotated by $45\\\\degree$ compared to their\\nusual orientation. In a suitable gauge, the dimer model is described by the\\nTemperley-Lieb algebra with loop fugacity $\\\\beta=2\\\\cos\\\\lambda=0$. It follows\\nthat the model is exactly solvable in geometries of arbitrary finite size. We\\nestablish and solve transfer matrix inversion identities on the strip with\\narbitrary finite width $N$. In the continuum scaling limit, in sectors with\\nmagnetization $S_z$, we obtain the conformal weights\\n$\\\\Delta_{s}=\\\\big((2-s)^2-1\\\\big)/8$ where $s=|S_z|+1=1,2,3,\\\\ldots$. We further\\nshow that the corresponding finitized characters $\\\\chit_s^{(N)}(q)$ decompose\\ninto sums of $q$-Narayana numbers or, equivalently, skew $q$-binomials. In the\\nparticle representation, the local face tile operators give a representation of\\nthe fermion algebra and the fermion particle trajectories play the role of\\nnonlocal degrees of freedom. We argue that, in the continuum scaling limit,\\nthere exist nontrivial Jordan blocks of rank 2 in the Virasoro dilatation\\noperator $L_0$. This confirms that, with quantum group invariant boundary\\nconditions, the dimer model gives rise to a {\\\\em logarithmic} conformal field\\ntheory with central charge $c=-2$, minimal conformal weight\\n$\\\\Delta_{\\\\text{min}}=-\\\\frac{1}{8}$ and effective central charge\\n$c_{\\\\text{eff}}=1$.Our analysis of the structure of the ensuing rank 2 modules\\nindicates that the familiar staggered $c=-2$ modules appear as submodules.\\n']. \n",

As\\nexpected, we find long-range string order both in the longitudinal and in the\\ntransverse channel in the Haldane phase, while in the Neel phase only the\\nlongitudinal order survives. In this way, the long-range string order can be\\nexplicitly related to the components of the magnetization of the XY model.\\nMoreover, apart from the critical line, where the decay is algebraic, we find\\nthat in the gapped phases the decay is governed by an exponential tail\\nmultiplied by algebraic factors. As regards the usual two points correlation\\nfunctions, we show that the longitudinal one behaves in a 'dual' fashion with\\nrespect to the transverse string correlator, namely both the asymptotic values\\nand the decay laws exchange when the transition line is crossed. For the\\ntransverse spin-spin correlator, we find a finite characteristic length which\\nis an unexpected feature at the critical point. We also comment briefly the\\nentanglement features of the original system versus those of the effective\\nmodel. The goodness of the approximation and the analytical predictions are\\nchecked versus density-matrix renormalization group calculations.\\n\"]. \n",

      " Abstract : [\"  If there is a dS/CFT correspondence, time evolution in the bulk should\\ntranslate to RG flows in the dual euclidean field theory. Consequently,\\nalthough the dual field is expected to be non-unitary, its RG flows will carry\\nan imprint of the unitary time evolution in the bulk. In this note we examine\\nthe prediction of holographic RG in de Sitter space for the flow of double and\\ntriple trace couplings in any proposed dual. We show quite generally that the\\ncorrect form of the field theory beta functions for the double trace couplings\\nis obtained from holography, provided one identifies the scale of the field\\ntheory with (i|T|) where T is the `time' in conformal coordinates. For dS(4),\\nwe find that with an appropriate choice of operator normalization, it is\\npossible to have real n-point correlation functions as well as beta functions\\nwith real coefficients. This choice leads to an RG flow with an IR fixed point\\nat negative coupling unlike in a unitary theory where the IR fixed point is at\\npositive coupling. The proposed correspondence of Sp(N) vector models with de\\nSitter Vasiliev gravity provides a specific example of such a phenomenon. For\\ndS(d+1) with even d, however, we find that no choice of operator normalization\\nexists which ensures reality of coefficients of the beta-functions as well as\\nabsence of n-dependent phases for various n-point functions, as long as one\\nassumes real coupling constants in the bulk Lagrangian.\\n\"]. \n",

In de Sitter space, these correlators are constrained both\\nby symmetries and by locality. In particular, the de Sitter isometries become\\nconformal symmetries on the future boundary of the spacetime, which are\\nreflected in a set of Ward identities that the boundary correlators must\\nsatisfy. We solve these Ward identities by acting with weight-shifting\\noperators on scalar seed solutions. Using this weight-shifting approach, we\\nderive three- and four-point correlators of massless spin-1 and spin-2 fields\\nwith conformally coupled scalars. Four-point functions arising from tree-level\\nexchange are singular in particular kinematic configurations, and the\\ncoefficients of these singularities satisfy certain factorization properties.\\nWe show that in many cases these factorization limits fix the structure of the\\ncorrelators uniquely, without having to solve the conformal Ward identities.\\nThe additional constraint of locality for massless spinning particles manifests\\nitself as current conservation on the boundary.

However, a\\nrecent analysis (based on a proposed single-field effective theory with an\\nimaginary speed of sound) found that the trispectrum and other higher-order,\\nnon-Gaussian correlators also undergo similar exponential enhancements. This\\narguably leads to `hyper-large' non-Gaussianities in stark conflict with\\nobservations, and even to the loss of perturbative control of the calculations.\\nIn this paper, we provide the first analytic solution of the growth of the\\nperturbations in two-field rapid-turn models, and find it in good agreement\\nwith previous numerical and single-field EFT estimates. We also show that the\\nnested structure of commutators of the in-in formalism has subtle and crucial\\nconsequences: accounting for these commutators, we show analytically that the\\nnaively leading-order piece (which indeed is exponentially large) cancels\\nexactly in all relevant correlators. The remaining non-Gaussianities of these\\nmodels are modest, and there is no problem with perturbative control from the\\nexponential enhancement of $\\\\zeta$.

This conjecture is motivated by a\\ngeneralization to strings of the rule for computing anomalous dimensions of\\nmassive particles and supergravity fields in the anti-de Sitter space. We show\\nthat this proportionality holds for a rotating closed string in global AdS\\nspace, representing a high spin operator made of fields in the adjoint\\nrepresentation. It is also valid for closed strings rotating in $S^5$\\n(representing operators with large R-charge), for closed strings with multiple\\nAdS spin, and for giant magnons. Based on this conjecture, we calculate the\\nanomalous dimension $\\\\delta$ of operators made of fields in the fundamental\\nrepresentation, associated with high spin mesons, and which are represented by\\nrotating open strings attached to probe D7-branes. The result is a logarithmic\\ndependence upon the spin, $\\\\delta\\\\sim \\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda}\\\\ln S$, similar to the\\nclosed string case. We show that the operator properties --- anomalous\\ndimension and spin --- are obtained from measurements made by a local observer\\nin the anti-de Sitter space. For the open string case, this ensures that these\\nquantities are independent of the mass scale introduced by the D7-branes (the\\nquark mass), as expected on physical grounds. In contrast, properties of the\\ngauge theory states, like the energy, correspond to measurements by a gauge\\ntheory observer and depend upon the mass scale --- once again, as expected.\\n']. \n",
