# Arxiv Recommender #

The Arxiv serves one of the most essential needs of modern science i.e. providing openaccess to research. It has more than 1.8 million research papers as of today, with more than15,000 submissions being added every month. This phenomenal rise of submissions has ledto enormous progress in science, but has also made it harder for researchers to find paperscloser to their research interests.Scientific papers contain subject specific jargon and knowledge, and a more complex semanticand logical structure. They are often difficult to understand even for humans, let alone acomputer. As a result, it is hard to meaningfully search for them using text based inquiriesonly. Although traditional search engines, such as Google, provide search results based onadvanced text similarity protocols, page-ranking algorithms, collaborative filtering and etc.,a model that is fine tuned on a corpus of scientific papers, such as the Arxiv, would beinvaluable. In this work, we create a contextual search engine and paper recommender byemploying the powerful methods recently developed by the ML community
