(i) At face value,\\ninformation is lost in the bulk but not in the CFT. This conflicts with the\\nAdS/CFT dictionary. (ii) No unique QFT state (pure or mixed) governs all\\ndetector responses to the bulk Hawking radiation. This conflicts with the\\nexistence of an S-matrix. (iii) Nonlocal couplings to the black hole interior\\ncause asymptotic detectors to respond as though the radiation was pure, even\\nthough it is naively thermal.

These correlation functions are related by a type of\\nFourier transform to the AdS phase shift of the dual 2-to-2 scattering process.\\nAdS unitarity was conjectured some time ago to be positivity of the imaginary\\npart of this bulk phase shift.

For large $N$ CFTs we further expand on these ideas, by\\nconsidering the phase shift in the Regge limit, which is dominated by the\\nleading Regge pole with spin $j(\\\\nu)$, where $\\\\nu$ is a spectral parameter. We\\ncompute the phase shift as a function of the bulk impact parameter, and then\\nuse AdS unitarity to impose bounds on the analytically continued OPE\\ncoefficients $C_{{\\\\cal J}{\\\\cal J}j(\\\\nu)}$ and $C_{TTj(\\\\nu)}$ that describe the\\ncoupling to the leading Regge trajectory of the current ${\\\\cal J}$ and stress\\ntensor $T$.

In some two\\ndimensional CFTs the correlation functions are precisely equal to the modular\\naverage of the contributions of a finite number of light states.

These correlation functions are related by a type of\\nFourier transform to the AdS phase shift of the dual 2-to-2 scattering process.\\nAdS unitarity was conjectured some time ago to be positivity of the imaginary\\npart of this bulk phase shift. This condition was recently proved using purely\\nCFT arguments. For large $N$ CFTs we further expand on these ideas, by\\nconsidering the phase shift in the Regge limit, which is dominated by the\\nleading Regge pole with spin $j(\\\\nu)$, where $\\\\nu$ is a spectral parameter. We\\ncompute the phase shift as a function of the bulk impact parameter, and then\\nuse AdS unitarity to impose bounds on the analytically continued OPE\\ncoefficients $C_{{\\\\cal J}{\\\\cal J}j(\\\\nu)}$ and $C_{TTj(\\\\nu)}$ that describe the\\ncoupling to the leading Regge trajectory of the current ${\\\\cal J}$ and stress\\ntensor $T$. AdS unitarity implies that the OPE coefficients associated to\\nnon-minimal couplings of the bulk theory vanish at the intercept value $\\\\nu=0$,\\nfor any CFT. Focusing on the case of large gap theories, this result can be\\nused to show that the physical OPE coefficients $C_{{\\\\cal J}{\\\\cal J}T}$ and\\n$C_{TTT}$, associated to non-minimal bulk couplings, scale with the gap\\n$\\\\Delta_g$ as $\\\\Delta_g^{-2}$ or $\\\\Delta_g^{-4}$. Also, looking directly at the\\nunitarity condition imposed at the OPE coefficients $C_{{\\\\cal J}{\\\\cal J}T}$ and\\n$C_{TTT}$ results precisely in the known conformal collider bounds, giving a\\nnew CFT derivation of these bounds. We finish with remarks on finite $N$\\ntheories and show directly in the CFT that the spin function $j(\\\\nu)$ is\\nconvex, extending this property to the continuation to complex spin.\\n']. \n",

We solve this\\nproblem in 4d conformal field theories at leading order in $1/N$. Viewed\\nholographically, this provides a field theory reconstruction of\\ncrossing-symmetric, four-point exchange amplitudes in AdS$_5$. Our solution\\ntakes the form of a resummation of the large spin solution to the crossing\\nequations, supplemented by corrections at finite spin, required by crossing.\\nThe method can be applied to the exchange of operators of arbitrary twist\\n$\\\\tau$ and spin $s$, although it vastly simplifies for even-integer twist,\\nwhere we give explicit results.

      " Abstract : ['  We present an analytic study of conformal field theories on the real\\nprojective space $\\\\mathbb{RP}^d$, focusing on the two-point functions of scalar\\noperators. Due to the partially broken conformal symmetry, these are\\nnon-trivial functions of a conformal cross ratio and are constrained to obey a\\ncrossing equation. After reviewing basic facts about the structure of\\ncorrelators on $\\\\mathbb{RP}^d$, we study a simple holographic setup which\\ncaptures the essential features of boundary correlators on $\\\\mathbb{RP}^d$. The\\nanalysis is based on calculations of Witten diagrams on the quotient space\\n$AdS_{d+1}/\\\\mathbb{Z}_2$, and leads to an analytic approach to two-point\\nfunctions. In particular, we argue that the structure of the conformal block\\ndecomposition of the exchange Witten diagrams suggests a natural basis of\\nanalytic functionals, whose action on the conformal blocks turns the crossing\\nequation into certain sum rules. We test this approach in the canonical example\\nof $\\\\phi^4$ theory in dimension $d=4-\\\\epsilon$, extracting the CFT data to\\norder $\\\\epsilon^2$. We also check our results by standard field theory methods,\\nboth in the large $N$ and $\\\\epsilon$ expansions.

From a\\nholographic perspective, these bulk theories are dual to two-dimensional CFTs\\nwith W_N symmetry algebras, and the black hole solutions are dual to thermal\\nstates with higher spin chemical potentials and charges turned on. Because the\\nnotion of horizon area is not gauge-invariant in the higher spin theory, the\\ntraditional approaches to the computation of black hole entropy must be\\nreconsidered. One possibility, explored in the recent literature, involves\\ndemanding the existence of a partition function in the CFT, and consistency\\nwith the first law of thermodynamics.

The string computation factorizes into a\\nstate-dependent sphere part and a universal AdS contribution which depends only\\non the dimensions of the operators and the cross ratios. We use the\\nintegrability of the AdS string equations to compute the AdS part for operators\\nof arbitrary conformal dimensions. The solution takes the form of TBA-like\\nintegral equations with the minimal AdS string-action computed by a\\ncorresponding free-energy-like functional. These TBA-like equations stem from a\\npeculiar system of functional equations which we call a \\\\chi-system. In\\nprinciple one could use the same method to solve for the AdS contribution in\\nthe N-point function. An interesting feature of the solution is that it encodes\\nmultiple string configurations corresponding to different classical\\nsaddle-points. The discrete data that parameterizes these solutions enters\\nthrough the analog of the chemical-potentials in the TBA-like equations.\\nFinally, for operators dual to strings spinning in the same equator in S^5\\n(i.e. BPS operators of the same type) the sphere part is simple to compute. In\\nthis case (which is generically neither extremal nor protected) we can\\nconstruct the complete, strong-coupling 4-point function.\\n']. \n",

      " Abstract : [\"  Inflation can be supported in very steep potentials if it is generated by\\nrapidly turning fields, which can be natural in negatively curved field spaces.\\nThe curvature perturbation, $\\\\zeta$, of these models undergoes an exponential,\\ntransient amplification around the time of horizon crossing, but can still be\\ncompatible with observations at the level of the power spectrum. However, a\\nrecent analysis (based on a proposed single-field effective theory with an\\nimaginary speed of sound) found that the trispectrum and other higher-order,\\nnon-Gaussian correlators also undergo similar exponential enhancements. This\\narguably leads to `hyper-large' non-Gaussianities in stark conflict with\\nobservations, and even to the loss of perturbative control of the calculations.\\nIn this paper, we provide the first analytic solution of the growth of the\\nperturbations in two-field rapid-turn models, and find it in good agreement\\nwith previous numerical and single-field EFT estimates. We also show that the\\nnested structure of commutators of the in-in formalism has subtle and crucial\\nconsequences: accounting for these commutators, we show analytically that the\\nnaively leading-order piece (which indeed is exponentially large) cancels\\nexactly in all relevant correlators. The remaining non-Gaussianities of these\\nmodels are modest, and there is no problem with perturbative control from the\\nexponential enhancement of $\\\\zeta$. Thus, rapid-turn inflation with negatively\\ncurved field spaces remains a viable and interesting class of candidate\\ntheories of the early universe.\\n\"]. \n",

      " Abstract : ['  We propose a new entry within the dictionary of the AdS/CFT duality at strong\\ncoupling: in the limit of a large spin or a large R-charge, the anomalous\\ndimension of the gauge theory operator dual to a semiclassical rotating string\\nis proportional to the string proper length. This conjecture is motivated by a\\ngeneralization to strings of the rule for computing anomalous dimensions of\\nmassive particles and supergravity fields in the anti-de Sitter space. We show\\nthat this proportionality holds for a rotating closed string in global AdS\\nspace, representing a high spin operator made of fields in the adjoint\\nrepresentation. It is also valid for closed strings rotating in $S^5$\\n(representing operators with large R-charge), for closed strings with multiple\\nAdS spin, and for giant magnons. Based on this conjecture, we calculate the\\nanomalous dimension $\\\\delta$ of operators made of fields in the fundamental\\nrepresentation, associated with high spin mesons, and which are represented by\\nrotating open strings attached to probe D7-branes. The result is a logarithmic\\ndependence upon the spin, $\\\\delta\\\\sim \\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda}\\\\ln S$, similar to the\\nclosed string case. We show that the operator properties --- anomalous\\ndimension and spin --- are obtained from measurements made by a local observer\\nin the anti-de Sitter space. For the open string case, this ensures that these\\nquantities are independent of the mass scale introduced by the D7-branes (the\\nquark mass), as expected on physical grounds. In contrast, properties of the\\ngauge theory states, like the energy, correspond to measurements by a gauge\\ntheory observer and depend upon the mass scale --- once again, as expected.\\n']. \n",

The scheme exhibits quadratic convergence, is capable of handling\\narbitrary brane trajectories, and is easily extendible to non-AdS bulk\\ngeometries. We use our method to contrast two different prescriptions for the\\nbulk fluctuation initial conditions found in the literature; namely, those of\\nHiramatsu et al.

Observationally, the main\\nconsequence of this work is to re-affirm previous claims that the stochastic\\ngravitational wave spectrum is predominantly flat, in contradiction with naive\\npredictions from the effective 4-dimensional theory.

Using known three-loop\\nanalytic expressions for the scattering amplitude, we find that the first power\\nsuppressed term has a very simple form, equal to a single power law.

      " Abstract : ['  We develop the idea of an effective conformal theory describing the low-lying\\nspectrum of the dilatation operator in a CFT. Such an effective theory is\\nuseful when the spectrum contains a hierarchy in the dimension of operators,\\nand a small parameter whose role is similar to that of 1/N in a large N gauge\\ntheory. These criteria insure that there is a regime where the dilatation\\noperator is modified perturbatively. Global AdS is the natural framework for\\nperturbations of the dilatation operator respecting conformal invariance, much\\nas Minkowski space naturally describes Lorentz invariant perturbations of the\\nHamiltonian. Assuming that the lowest-dimension single-trace operator is a\\nscalar, O, we consider the anomalous dimensions, gamma(n,l), of the\\ndouble-trace operators of the form O (del^2)^n (del)^l O. Purely from the CFT\\nwe find that perturbative unitarity places a bound on these dimensions of\\n|gamma(n,l)|<4. Non-renormalizable AdS interactions lead to violations of the\\nbound at large values of n. We also consider the case that these interactions\\nare generated by integrating out a heavy scalar field in AdS. We show that the\\npresence of the heavy field \"unitarizes\" the growth in the anomalous\\ndimensions, and leads to a resonance-like behavior in gamma(n,l) when n is\\nclose to the dimension of the CFT operator dual to the heavy field. Finally, we\\ndemonstrate that bulk flat-space S-matrix elements can be extracted from the\\nlarge n behavior of the anomalous dimensions.
